                    <h4>1. Provision of aggregated, non-identifiable usage information to Pioneer</h4>
                    <p>The third-party analytics tool, called Flurry Analytics from Yahoo!, uses analytics data sent to Flurry’s servers from a Flurry software agent embedded in the App on your device. Information collected through Flurry Analytics is used by Yahoo! to provide Pioneer with aggregated, non-identifiable App usage information.</p>
                    <p>Pioneer receives aggregated, non-identifiable reports on usage from Flurry (“reports”). Pioneer uses those reports to track how the compatible Pioneer product, App and compatible third-party apps are used in order to</p>

                    <p>The information collected by Yahoo! can also be used to improve Yahoo!’s services, including the Flurry Analytics and Advertising services. Yahoo! may especially use the information to target the advertising you see on some of the other apps on your device.</p>
                    <p>In this regard, Yahoo! Inc. (a U.S. based corporation, with an address at Yahoo! Inc., Customer Care - Privacy Policy Issues, 701 First Avenue, Sunnyvale, CA 94089, USA. +1 (408) 349-5070) is the controller for the processing of the information and its privacy policy governs the processing of your information.
